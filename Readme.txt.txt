***********************************************************************
I have used jquery backstretch plugin for the layout of my website design.
I havepulled data from about,people,degrees,minors,employment,research endpoints
of RESTAPI.
***********************************************************************
The about end point data is simply displayed.

The People data uses Jquery UI plugin to display both faculty and staff.

The Degrees data uses Accordion from JqueryUI to display both undergraduate and 
graduate programs as well as graduate certificates.

The Minors data uses Tabs from JqueryUI to display the UGMinors data.

The Employment data uses JsGrid plugin to display table grid of information
of co-op as well as full-time employment details.

The Research data uses Menu from JqueryUI to display data for both ByInterest
and ByFaculty sections. 

************************************************************************
For the endpoints having two sections, code was reused to retrieve the data from
RESTAPI.
The pages are well organized so that it is easy for the user to understand the
content on website.
